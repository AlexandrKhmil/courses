### Focused and Diffuse Modes

#### Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

Researchers have found that we have two fundamentally different modes of thinking. Here, I'll call them the **Focused** and the **Diffuse modes**.

We're familiar with **focusing**. It's when you concentrate intently on something you're trying to learn or to understand.

But we're not so familiar with **diffuse thinking**. Turns out that this more relaxed thinking style is related to a set of neural resting states.

In this diffuse mode of thinking, you can look at things broadly from a very different, big-picture perspective. You can make new neural connections traveling along new pathways. You can't focus in as tightly as you often need to, to finalize any kind of problem solving. Or understand the finest aspects of a concept. But you can at least get to the initial place you need to be in to home in on a solution

Now as far as neuroscientists know right now, you're either in the focused mode or the diffuse mode of thinking. It seems you can't be in both thinking modes at the same time.

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes

So, the bottom line is, when you're learning something new, especially something that's a little more difficult, your mind needs to be able to go back and forth between the two different learning modes. That's what helps you learn effectively.

To build neural structure, *you need to do a little work every day*, gradually allowing yourself to grow a neuro-scaffold to hang your thinking on a little bit, every day.

#### What is Learning

There are a million billion synapses in your brain where memories are stored. The old view of the brain is that once it matures, the strengths of synapses can be adjusted by learning, but the pattern of connectivity does not change much unless there is brain damage. But now we know that brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures.

With new optical techniques for imaging single connections between neurons called synapses, we can see constant turnover, with new synapses being formed and others disappearing. This raises a puzzle.

In the face of so much turnover, how do memories stay stable over so many years? This is a picture of one dendritic branch on a neuron which receives inputs from other neurons. The synapses are on the spiny knobs coming off the dendrite. On the top, the dendrite was imaged before learning. The same dendrite is shown below after learning and after sleep. Multiple synapses that are newly formed together on the same branch are indicated by the white arrowheads. You are looking down into the brain of a live animal. This is really a fantastic new technique.

### Procastination Memory and Sleep

#### Preview Procastination

Everybody has some issues with procrastination. Because if you're working on something, it means you're not working, on a lot of other things. But some people have more issues with procrastination than others.

When you look at something that you really rather not do, it seems that you activate the areas of your brain associated with pain. Your brain, naturally enough, looks for a way to stop that negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else.

*But here's the trick.* Researchers discovered that not long after people might start actually working out what they didn't like, that neurodiscomfort disappeared.

So it seems what happens when you procrastinate, is something like this:

1. First, you observe, and get a cue about something that causes a tiny bit of unease.
2. You don't like it, so to make the sensation go away you turn your attention from whatever caused that unease.
3. You turn toward something more pleasant.
4. The result, you feel happier, temporarily.

But in the mean, time I'm going to let you in on a handy little mental tool. This tool is called, the **Pomodoro**. It was invented by Francesco Cirillo, in the early 1980's. All you need to do, is set a timer to 25 minutes, turn off all interruptions, and then focus.

The only last important thing is to give yourself a little reward when you're done. A few minutes of web surfing, a cup of coffee, or a bite of chocolate, even just stretching or chatting mindlessly, allowing your brain to enjoyably change its focus for a while.

You'll find that using the Pomodoro technique is very effective. It's a little like doing an intense 25 minute workout at a mental gym. Followed by some mental relaxation.

#### Introduction into Memory

When I look back on my childhood or I remember some words from Spanish, or Russian, or bring to mind one of Maxwell's equations, I'm drawing on portions of my brain involved in long-term memory, but when I'm trying to hold a few ideas in mind to connect them together so I can understand a concept or solve a problem, I'm using my working memory. Obviously, sometimes I'll bring something from my long-term memory into my working memory so I can think about it.

So the two types of memory are related. There are lots of different ways to slice our understanding of memory, but for this course on learning, we're going to talk about only these two major memory systems; **working memory** and **long-term memory**.

**Working memory** is the part of memory that has to do with what you're immediately and consciously processing in your mind. Your working memory is centered out of the prefrontal cortex although as we'll see later, there are also connections to other parts of your brain so you can access long-term memories. Researchers used to think that our working memory could hold around seven items or chunks, but now it's widely believed that the working memory holds only about four chunks of information. We tend to automatically group memory items into chunks so it seems our working memory is bigger than it actually is. Although your working memory is like a blackboard, it's not a very good blackboard. You often need to keep repeating what you're trying to work with so it stays in your working memory. For example, you'll sometimes repeat a phone number to yourself until you have a chance to write it down. Repetitions needed so that your metabolic vampires that is natural dissipating processes don't suck those memories away. You may find yourself shutting your eyes to keep any other items from intruding into the limited slots of your working memory as you concentrate. So, we know that short-term memory is something like an inefficient mental blackboard.

The other form of memory, **long term memory** is wide a storage warehouse, and just like a warehouse, it's distributed over a big area. Different kinds of long-term memories are stored in different regions of the brain. Research has shown that when you first try to put an item of information in long-term memory, you need to revisit it at least a few times to increase the chances that you'll be able to find it later when you might need it. The long-term memory storage warehouse is immense, it's got room for billions of items. In fact there can be so many items they can bury each other. So it can be difficult for you to find the information you need unless you practice and repeat at least a few times. Long-term memory is important because it's where you store fundamental concepts and techniques that are often involved in whatever you're learning about.

When you encounter something new, you often use your working memory to handle it. If you want to move that information into your long-term memory, it often takes time and practice. To help with this process, use a technique called **spaced repetition**.

This technique involves repeating what you're trying to retain, but what you want to do is a space this repetition out. Repeating a new vocabulary word or a problem solving technique for example over a number of days. Extending your practice over several days does make a difference. Research has shown that if you try to glue things into your memory by repeating something 20 times in one evening for example, it won't stick nearly as well as if you practice it the same number of times over several days. This is like building the brick wall we saw earlier, if you don't leave time for the mortar to dry, that is time for the synoptic connections to form and strengthen, you won't have a very good structure, and talk about lasting structure.

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

You might be surprised to learn that just plain being awake creates toxic products in your brain. How does the brain get rid of these poisons? Turns out that when you sleep, your brain cells shrink. This causes an increase in the space between your brain cells. It's like unblocking a stream. Fluid can flow past these cells and wash the toxins out. So, sleep which can sometimes seem like such a waste of time is actually your brain's way of keeping itself clean and healthy.

So, let's get right to a critical idea. Taking a test without getting enough sleep means you're operating with a brain that got little metabolic toxins floating around in it, poisons, and make it so you can't think very clearly.

In fact, getting too little sleep doesn't just make you do worse on tests. Too little sleep over too long of a time can also be associated with all sorts of nasty conditions including headaches, depression, heart disease, diabetes and just plain dying earlier. But sleep does more than just allow your brain to wash away toxins. It's actually an important part of the memory and learning process.

It seems that during sleep, your brain tidies up ideas and concepts you're thinking about and learning. It erases the less important parts of memories and simultaneously strengthens areas that you need or want to remember. During sleep, your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you're trying to learn, going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them. Sleep has also been shown to make a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you're trying to learn. It's as if the complete deactivation of the conscious you in the prefrontal cortex at the forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking more easily to one another allowing them to put together the neural solution to your learning task while you're sleeping.

Of course, you must also plant the seed for your diffuse mode by first doing focused mode work. If you're going over what you're learning right before you take a nap or going to sleep for the evening, you have an increased chance of dreaming about it. If you go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material it seems to improve your chances of dreaming about it, still further. Dreaming about what you're studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand.

### Summary Week 1

In essence people have two fundamentally different modes of thinking that, for
the purposes of this course, we've labeled **focused** and **diffuse**.

The **focus mood** is centered on the prefrontal cortex and it often seems to involve thinking about things you are somewhat familiar with. For example if you're familiar with multiplication and you're trying to solve a multiplication problem, or you're trying to find a word that rhymes with another word. You're probably stepping along the somewhat familiar pathways of the focused mode.

But if you're trying to solve or figure out something new, it often cries out for the more broad ranging perspectives of the **diffuse mode**. This mode, as it turns out, is representative of the brain's many neural resting states. Creative thinkers throughout history, whatever their discipline have found ways to access the diffuse mode often more directly and quickly. But we all access this mode quite naturally when we do things like go for a walk or take a shower or even just drift off to sleep. When we find ourselves stuck on a problem, or even if we're unsure of a situation, the course of living our daily life.

It's often a good idea once you've focused directly on the situation. To let things settle back and take a bit more time. That way more neural processing can take place, often below conscious awareness in the diffuse mode. The thing is it often takes time for neural processing to take place, and time, as well, to build the new neural structures that allow us to learn something now.

This is why tackling procrastination is so very important. The easiest way to tackle procrastination is to use the **Pomodoro technique**. That brief, 25 minute stretch of focuses concentration followed by a bit of mental relaxation.

It's through practice and repetition that we can help enhance and strengthen the neural structures we're building as we're learning something new. Practice and repetition is particularly important for more abstract topics. Memory of course is an important aspect of learning. There are four slots in our working memory. Things can fall out of those slots unless we keep repeating them to hold them in mind.

In that sense working memory is like a not very good blackboard. Long term memory, on the other hand, is like a storage warehouse. If you practiced and repeated something well enough to get it into long-term memory, you can usually call it up later if you need, although you may need an occasional bit of repetition to freshen the memory up.

It's never a good idea to cram your learning by repeating things many times all in one day. We've also learned that the importance of sleep and washing away the toxins that develop during our days activities. We want to avoid taking tests or doing anything difficult with little sleep the night before cause its like trying to think with poison on the brain.

And just as importantly, exercise is surprisingly valuable in helping both improve our memory and our ability to learn.

## Week 2

### Chunking - The Essentials

#### What is Chunk

When you first look at a brand new concept it sometimes doesn't make much sense, as shown by the jumbled puzzle pieces here.

**Chunking** is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning. The new logical whole makes the chunk easier to remember, and also makes it easier to fit the chunk into the larger picture of what you're learning.

Just memorizing a fact without understanding or context doesn't help you understand what's really going on or how the concept fits together with other concepts you're learning.

We talked earlier about working memory and how those four slots of working memory appear to hang out in the part of your brain right behind your forehead known as the prefrontal cortex. When you're focusing your attention on something it's almost as if you have an octopus. The octopus of attention that slips it's tentacles through those four slots of working memory when necessary to help you make connections to information that you might have in various parts of your brain. Remember, this is different from the random connections of the diffuse mode. Focusing your attention to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of the focused mode of learning. It is also often what helps get you started in creating a chunk. Interestingly when you're stressed your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some of those connections. This is why your brain doesn't seem to work right when you're angry, stressed, or afraid.

Chunks are pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, through bound together through meaning or use. You can take the letters P-O and P and bind them together into one conceptual easy to remember chunk, the word pop. It's like converting a, a cumbersome computer file into a ZIP file. Underneath that single pop chunk is a symphony of neurons that have learned to sing in tune with one another. The complex neural activity that ties together our simplifying abstract chunks of thought. Whether those thoughts pertain to acronyms, ideas, or concepts are the basis of much of the science, literature, and art.

As it turns out one of the first steps towards gaining expertise in academic topics is to create conceptual chunks, mental leaps that unite scattered bits of information through meaning.

The concept of neural chunks also applies to sports, music, dance, really just about anything that humans can get good at. Basically, a chunk means a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively.

Focused practice and repetition, the creation of strong memory traces, helps you to create chunks. The path to expertise is built little by little, small chunks can become larger, and all of the expertise serves to underpin more creative interpretations as you gradually become a master of the material.

Chunking helps your brain run more efficiently. Once you chunk an idea, a concept, or an action, you don't know need to remember all the little underlying details.

#### How to Form a Chunk - Part 1

If you're learning to play a difficult song on the guitar, the neural representation of the song in your mind can be considered as a rather large chunk. You would first listen to the song. Maybe you'd even watch someone else playing the song especially if you were just a beginner who was learning things like how to hold the guitar.

Getting an initial sense of the pattern you want to master for yourself is similar for most subjects or skills. You often have to grasp little bits of songs that become neural mini chunks which will later join together into larger chunks.

For example, over several days you might learn how to smoothly play some musical passages on the guitar, and when you've grasped those passages, you could join them together with other passages that you've gradually putting everything together so you can play the song.

In learning a sport, say basketball, soccer, golf, you grasp and master various bits and pieces of the skills you need. You're creating little neural mini chunks that you can then gradually knit together into larger neural chunks. Later, you can knit those larger chunks into still larger and more complex chunks that you can draw up in an instant in reaction say to a slight shift and twist in the soccer ball that's coming your way.

The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together. That actually is the point of making complex ideas, movements or reactions into a single chunk.

You can see this in language learning. In the beginning, often just saying a single word with the proper nuance, tone, and accent involves a lot of practice. Stringing extemporaneous sentences together involves the ability to creatively mix together various complex mini chunks and chunks in the new language.

Learning in math and science involves the same approach. When you're learning new math and science material, you're often given sample problems with worked out solutions. This is because, when you're first trying to understand how to work a problem, you have a heavy cognitive load. So, it helps to start out with a work-through example. It's like first listening to a song before trying to play the song yourself.

Most of the details of the worked out solution are right there and your job is simply to figure out why the steps are taken the way they are. They can help you see the key features and underlying principles of a problem.

#### How to Form a Chunk - Part 2

Every discipline is a little different. Chunking in the subject of history for example, is quite different from chunking in Chemistry or in karate. In my explanations here, I'm going to lean a little more towards explaining chunking of mental ideas rather than physical body motions, but you'll see that the two approaches are closely related. So, whether you're learning something mental or something physical, you'll find some helpful ideas here.

**The first step** on chunking is simply to focus your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.

If you had the television going on in the background or you're looking up every few minutes to check or answer your phone or computer messages, it means you're going to have more difficulty in making a chunk, because your brain is not really focusing on chunking the new material. When you first begin to learn something, you're making new neural patterns and connecting them with preexisting patterns that are spread through many areas of the brain. Your octopus tentacles, so to speak, can't reach very well if some of them are off on other thoughts using up some of the limited slots in your working memory.

**The second step** in chunking is to understand the basic idea you're trying to chunk, whether its understanding a concepts such as continental drift, seeing the connection between the basic elements of a plot for a story, grasping the economic principle of supply and demand, or comprehending the essence of a particular type of math problem. Students can often synthesize the gist, that is figure out the main idea or ideas pretty naturally, or at least they can grasp those ideas if they allow the focused and diffused modes of thinking to take turns in helping them figure out what's going on. Understanding is like a super glue that helps hold the underlying memory traces together. It creates broad encompassing traces that can link to other memory traces.

Can you create a chunk if you don't understand? Yes, but it's often a useless chunk that won't fit in with or relate to other material you're learning. That said, it's important to realize that just understanding how a problem was solved for example, does not necessarily create a chunk that you can easily call to mind later.

That's part of what you can grasp an idea when a teacher presented in class, but if you don't review it fairly soon after you first learned it, it can seem incomprehensible when it comes time to prepare for a test. In math and science related subjects, closing the book and testing yourself on whether you yourself can solve the problem you think you understand will speed up your learning at this stage.

You often realize the first time you actually understand something is when you can actually do it yourself. It's the same in many disciplines. Just looking at someone else's painting doesn't mean you could actually create that painting yourself, and just hearing a song won't give you the expertise you need to sing it in the same resonant fashion. Just because you see it or even that you understand it, it doesn't mean that you can actually do it. Only doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underlie true mastery.

**The third step** to chunking is gaining context, so you can see not just how but also when to use this chunk. Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly, repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems, so that you can see not only when to use the chunk but when not to use it. This helps you see how your newly formed chunk fits into the bigger picture. In other words, you may have a tool in your strategy or problem solving tool box but if you don't know when to use that tool it's not going to do you a lot of good.

Ultimately, practice helps you broaden the networks of neurons that are connected to your chunk, ensuring it's not only firm but also accessible from many different paths. As you can see from this **top-down**, **bottom-up** illustration, learning takes place in two ways.

There's a **bottom-up chunking process** where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily access it whenever you need to.

There's also a **top-down** big picture process that allows you to see what you're learning and where it fits in.

Both processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material. **Context** is where bottom-up and top-down learning meet. To clarify here, chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem solving technique. Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique. Doing a rapid two-minute picture walk through a chapter in a book before you begin studying it, glancing at pictures and section headings can allow you to gain a sense of the big picture, so can listening to a very well-organized lecture.

These kinds of activities can help you know where to put the chunks you're constructing, how the chunks relate to one another; just as you see here with the image of the man in the car. Learn the major concepts or points first, these are often the key parts of a good instructor or on book chapters, outline, flow charts, tables, or concept maps. Once you have this done, fill in the details. Even if a few of the puzzle pieces are missing at the end of your studies, you can still see the big picture. So, there you go. Summing it up, chunks are best built with focused attention, understanding of the basic idea, and practice to help you gain mastery and a sense of the big picture context. Those are the essential steps in making a chunk and fitting that chunk into a greater conceptual overview of what you're learning, but there's more.

#### Illusions of Competence

One of the most common approaches for trying to learn material from a book or from notes is simply to reread it. But psychologist, Jeffrey Karpicke, has shown that this approach is actually much less productive than another, very simple, technique. **Recall**. After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read.

*Karpicke's research*, published in the Journal Science, provided solid evidence along these lines. Students studied a scientific text and then practiced it, by recalling as much of the information as they could. Then they re-studied the text and recalled it again. That is, they tried to remember the key ideas, once more. The results, in the same amount of time, by simply practising and recalling the material students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach. Including simply rereading the text a number of times. Or **drawing concept maps** that supposedly enrich the relationships in the materials under study. This improved learning comes whether students take a formal test, or just informally test themselves. This gives an important reminder. When we retrieve knowledge, we're not just being mindless robots. The retrieval process itself enhances deep learning, and helps us to begin forming chunks.

It's almost as if the recall process helps build in little neural hooks, that we can hang our thinking on. Even more of a surprise to researchers, was that the students themselves predicted that simply reading and recalling the materials, wasn't the best way to learn. They thought, concept mapping, drawing diagrams that show the relationship between the concepts would be the best.

But if you're trying to build connections between chunks, before the basic chunks are embedded in the brain, it doesn't work as well.

Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make your study time more focused and effective. The only time rereading text seems to be effective, is if you let time pass between the rereading, so that it becomes more of an exercise in spaced repetition.

One way to think about this type of learning and recall, is shown right here. As we mentioned earlier, there are four or so slots, in working memory. When you're first learning how to understand a concept, or technique to solve a problem, your entire working memory is involved in the process.

As shown by this sort of, mad tangle of connections between the four slots of working memory. As you begin to chunk the concept, you will feel it connecting more easily and smoothly in your mind. Once the concept is chunked, it takes up only one slot in working memory. It simultaneously becomes one smooth strand that's easy to follow, and to use to make new connections. The rest of your working memory is left clear. That dangling strand of chunked material has, in some sense, increased the amount of information available to your working memory. It's as if the slot in working memory is a hyperlink that's been connected to a great big web page. Now, you understand, why it is key that you are the one doing the problem solving or mastering the concept.

Not whoever wrote the solution manual, or book, on whatever subject you're studying. If you just look at the solution, for example, then tell yourself. Oh yeah, I see why they did that. Then the solution is not really yours. You've done almost nothing to knit those concepts into your own underlying neural circuitry. Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning. You must have the information persisting in your memory if you're to master the material well enough to do well on tests and to think creatively with it.

In a related thing, you may be surprised to learn that highlighting and underlining must be done very carefully. Otherwise it can not only be ineffective, but also misleading. It's as if, making lots of motions with your hand can fool you into thinking you've placed the concept in your brain. If you do mark up the text, try to look for main ideas before making any marks. And try to keep your underlining or highlighting to a minimum. One sentence or less per paragraph. On the other hand, words or notes in a margin that synthesize key concepts are a very good idea.

Jeff Karpicke, the same researcher who's done such important work
related to recall, has also done research on a related topic.
Illusions of competence in learning.

The reason students like to keep rereading their notes or a textbook, is that when they have the book or Google open right in front of them, it provides the illusion that the material is also in their brains. But it's not, because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusions studying in a way that just isn't very effective.

This is a reminder that just wanting to learn the material, and spending a lot of time with it, doesn't guarantee you'll actually learn it. A super helpful way to make sure you're learning and not fooling yourself with illusions of competence, is to test yourself on whatever you're learning. In some sense, that's what recall is actually doing. Allowing you to see whether or not you really grasp an idea.

If you make a mistake in what you are doing, it's actually a very good thing. You want to try not to repeat your mistakes, of course, but mistakes are very valuable to make in your little self tests before high stakes real tests. Because they allow you to make repairs and you're thinking flaws bit by bit mistakes help correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better.

As you know now recall is a powerful tool. But here's another tip, recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material. You don't realize it, but when you are learning something new you can often take in subliminal cues for the room and the space around you at the time you were originally learning the material. This can throw you off when you take tests because you often take tests in a room that's different from the room you were learning in. By recalling and thinking about the material when you are in various physical environment, you become independent of the cues from any one given location. That helps you avoid the problem of the test room being different from where you originally learned the material.

### Seeing the Bigger Picture

#### What Motivates You

Most of the neurons in your cortex carry information about what is happening around you and what you're doing. Your brain also has a set of diffusely projecting systems of **neuromodulators** that carry information not about the content of an experience but its importance and value to your future.

**Neuromodulators** are chemicals that influence how a neuron responds to other neurons, and today we will discuss three of them: **acetylcholine**, **dopamine**, and **serotonin**.

**Acetylcholine neurons** form neuromodulatory connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning when you are paying close attention. These acetylcholine neurons project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity leading to new long term memory. Neuromodulators also have a profound impact on your unconscious mind.

One of the great brain discoveries in my lifetime has been that
our motivation is controlled by a particular chemical substance called **dopamine**.

These **dopamine neurons** are part of a large brain system that controls reward learning, and in particular, in the basal ganglia which is located in the green region above the dopamine neurons and below the cortex at the top of the brain. Dopamine is released from these neurons when we receive an unexpected reward. Dopamine signals project widely and have a very powerful effect on learning, and this is something that also affects decision-making, and even the value of sensory inputs. Dopamine is in the business of predicting future rewards and not just the immediate reward. This can motivate you to do something that may not be rewarding right now, but will lead to a much better reward in the future.

Addictive drugs artificially increase dopamine activity and fool your brain into thinking that something wonderful has just happened. In fact, just the opposite has just happened. This leads to craving and dependence which can hijack your free will and can motivate actions that are harmful too.

Loss of dopamine neurons leads to a lack of motivation and something called anhedonia, which is a loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure. Severe loss of dopamine neurons causes resting tremor, slowness, rigidity, this is called Parkinson's disease. Ultimately, it leads to catatonia, a complete lack of any movement.

**Serotonin** is a third diffuse neuromodulatory system that strongly affects your social life.

In monkey troops, the Alpha male has the highest level of serotonin activity, and the lowest ranking male has the lowest levels. Prozac, which is prescribed for clinical depression, raises the level of serotonin activity. The level of serotonin is also closely linked to risk-taking behavior, with higher risk in lower serotonin monkeys. Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of serotonin activity in society.

Finally, your emotions strongly affect learning as you are well aware. Emotions were once thought to be separate from cognition, but recent research has shown that emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with learning and memory.

The **amygdala** is one of the major centers where cognition and emotion are effectively integrated. The amygdala is a part of the limbic system which, together with hippocampus, is involved in processing memory and decision-making as well as regulating emotional reactions. You will want to keep your amygdala happy to be an effective learner. The emotions and your neuromodulatory systems are slower than perception and action, but are no less important for successful learning.

#### The Value of a Library of Chunks

Basically, what people do to enhance their knowledge and gain expertise, is to gradually build the number of chunks in their mind, valuable bits of information they can piece together in new and creative ways.

The bigger and more well-practiced your chunked mental library, whatever the subject you're learning, the more easily you'll be able to solve problems and figure out solutions.

Chunks can also help you understand new concepts. This is because when you grasp one chunk, you'll find that that chunk can be related in surprising ways to similar chunks, not only in that field but also in very different fields. This idea is called **transfer**.

> For example, concepts and problem solving method you learned for physics, can be very similar to chunked concepts in business.

A chunk is a way of compressing information much more compactly.

As you gain more experience in chunking in any particular subject, you'll see that the chunks you're able to create are bigger, in some sense that the ribbons are longer. Not only are those ribbons longer, but the neural patterns are in some sense darker. They're more solid and firmly ingrained.

If you have a library of concepts and solutions internalized as chunked patterns, you can think of it as a collection or a library of neural patterns. When you're trying to figure something out, if you have a good library of these chunks, you can more easily skip to the right solution by metaphorically speaking, listening to whispers from your diffuse mode. Your diffuse mode can help you connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems.

Another way to think of it is this, as you build each chunk it is filling in a part of your larger knowledge picture, but if you don't practice with your growing chunks, they can remain faint and it's harder to put together the big picture of what you're trying to learn.

In building a chunked library, you're training your brain to recognize not only a specific concept, but different types and classes of concepts so that you can automatically know how to solve quickly or handle whatever you encounter.  You'll start to see patterns and simplify problem-solving for you and will soon find that different solution techniques are lurking at the edge of your memory.

Before midterms or finals, it can be easy to brush up and have these solutions at the mental ready.

There are *two ways to figure something out or to solve problems*. First, through sequential step-by-step reasoning and second, through a more holistic intuition.

**Sequential thinking** where each small step leads deliberately towards a solution, involves the focused mode.

**Intuition** on the other hand, often seems to require this creative diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts. Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition, because these new ideas make a leap away from what you're familiar with.

Keep in mind that the diffuse modes, semi-random way of making connections means that the solutions it provides should be very carefully verified using the focused mode. Intuitive insights aren't always correct.

You may think there are so many problems and concepts just in a single section or chapter of whatever you're studying. There's just no way to learn them all. Just focus on whatever section you're studying. You'll find that once you put that first problem or concept in your mental library, whatever it is, then the second concept will go in a little more easily and the third more easily still.

#### Overlearning Choking Einstellugn and Interleaving

When you're learning a new idea you sometimes tend to practice it over and over again during the same study session. A little of this is useful and necessary, but continuing to study or practice after you've mastered what you can in the session is called **overlearning**.

**Overleaning** can have its place.
It can produce an automaticity that can be important.

>Did you know that even expert public speakers practice on the order of 70 hours for a typical 20-minute TED Talk?

Automaticity can indeed be helpful in times of nervousness, butbe wary of repetitive overlearning during a single session. Research has shown it can be a waste of valuable learning time.

The reality is, once you've got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn't strengthen the kinds of long term memory connections you want to have strengthened. Worse yet, focusing on one technique is a little like learning carpentry by only practicing with a hammer. After awhile you think you can fix anything by just bashing at it. 

Using a subsequent study session to repeat what you're trying to learn is just fine and often valuable. It can strengthen and deepen your chunked neuron patterns. But be wary; repeating something you already know perfectly well, is, face it, easy.

It can also bring the **illusion of competence** that you've mastered the full range of material, when you've actually only mastered the easy stuff.

Instead, you want to balance your studies by deliberately focusing on what you find more difficult. This focusing on the more difficult material is called **deliberate practice**. It's often what makes the difference between a good student and a great student. All this is also related to a concept known as **Einstellung**.

In this phenomenon, your initial simple thought, an idea you already have in mind or a neural pattern you've already developed and strengthened, may prevent a better idea or solution from being found.

The crowded bumpers of the focus mode and the previous patterns you built can create a sort of rut that prevents you from springing to a new place where the solution might be found. You have to unlearn your erroneous older ideas or
approaches even while you're learning new ones.

One significant mistake students sometimes make in learning is jumping into the water before they learn to swim. In other words, they blindly start working on homework without reading the text book, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or even speaking with someone knowledgeable.

Mastering a new subject means learning not only the basic chunks, but also learning how to select and use different chunks. The best way to learn that is by practicing jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies. This is called **interleaving**.

Once you have the basic idea of the technique down during your study session start interleaving your practice with problems of different types or different types of approaches, concepts, procedures. Sometimes this can be a little tough to do.

A given section in a book, for example, is often devoted to a specific technique, so when you flip to that section you already know which technique you're going to be using. Still, do what you can to mix up your learning. In science and math in particular it can help to look ahead at the more varied problem sets that are sometimes found at the end of chapters. Or you can deliberately try to make yourself occasionally pick out why some problems call for one technique as opposed to another.

You want your brain to become used to the idea that just knowing how to use a particular concept, approach, or problem-solving technique isn't enough. You also need to know when to use it.

Interleaving your studies, making it a point to review for a test, for example, by skipping around through problems in the different chapters and materials can sometimes seem to make your learning a little more difficult, but in reality, it helps you learn more deeply. Interleaving is extraordinarily important.

Although practice and repetition is important in helping build solid neural patterns to draw on, it's interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity. It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, and begin thinking more independently.

When you interleave within one subject or one discipline, you begin to develop your creative power within that discipline.

When you interleave between several subjects or disciplines, you can more easily make interesting new connections between chunks in the different fields, which can enhance your creativity even further. Of course it takes time to develop solid chunks of knowledge in different fields, so sometimes there's a trade off.

Developing expertise in several fields means you can bring very new ideas from one field to the other, but it can also mean that your expertise in one field or the other isn't quite as deep as that of the person who specializes in only one discipline. On the other hand, if you develop expertise in only one discipline, you may know it very deeply but you may become more deeply entrenched in your familiar way of thinking and not be able to handle new ideas.

### Summary for Week 2

**Chunks** are pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, that are bound together through use and often through meaning.

You can think of a chunk as a scintillating network of neurons that compactly synthesizes key ideas or actions.

Chunks can get bigger and more complex. But at the same time, they're a single easy to access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory.

Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the basic idea. And practice to help deepen your patterns and to help you gain big picture context.

Simple **recall**, trying to remember the key points without looking at the page, is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along. It seems to help build neural hooks. They help you better understand the material. Also try recalling material in places that are different from where you originally learned the material, so it becomes more deeply ingrained and accessible, regardless of what room you're in. This can be very helpful for tests.

**Transfer** is the idea that a chunk you've mastered in one area can often help you much more easily learn chunks of information in different areas that can share surprising commonalities. **Interleave** your learning by practicing your choice of different concepts, approach, and techniques all in one session.

Chunks are very important, but they don't necessarily build flexibility, which is also important in becoming an expert with the material you're learning.

**Illusions of competence in learning**. Learn to recognize when you're fooling yourself about whether you're actually learning the material.

**Test yourself frequently**. Using little mini-tests to see whether you're actually learning the material, or whether you've been fooling yourself, thinking you're learning when you're actually not.

**Recall** is actually a form of mini-testing. Try to avoid depending too much on highlighting, which can fool you into thinking that the material is going into your brain when it actually isn't.

Mistakes are a good thing to make when you're learning. They allow you to catch illusions of competence.

Avoid practicing only the easy stuff, which can bring the illusion that you've mastered the material. **Deliberately practice** what you find more difficult to gain full mastery of the material.

**Einstellung** is when your initial thought, an idea you've already had in mind, or a neural pattern you've already developed well and strengthened, prevents a better idea or solution from being found. Or keeps you from being flexible enough to accept new, better, or more appropriate solutions.

Just pick one tiny thing out to learn, then another. Just keep trying and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the results.
